Our task is to use statistical techniques to derive insights from the dataset. This will involve:
1. Descriptive Analysis: Understanding the basic statistical properties of the data, such as central tendency and variability.
2. Probability and Sampling: Exploring the probabilities of loan default among
different segments and testing the robustness of these findings using various sampling techniques.
3. Hypothesis Testing: Conducting hypothesis tests to determine the significance of various factors, such as income levels, gender, and ownership status, on loan defaults.
4. Distribution Analysis: Examining the distribution of key financial variables to understand their spread and shape, which will guide further statistical analysis.
5. Advanced Statistical Testing: Using more sophisticated techniques such as
ANOVA and chi-square tests to uncover relationships between categorical and numerical variables.
Expected Outcomes: By the end of this analysis, you should be able to:
Identify which demographic and financial factors are most strongly associated with loan defaults.
Determine if there are significant differences between various segments of the population (e.g., based on gender or contract type).
Validate or refute claims regarding the average values of key financial variables (e.g., income, annuities).
Provide actionable insights that the financial institution can use to improve its loan approval process, better assess risk, and potentially reduce the rate of defaults.
This comprehensive statistical analysis will provide a robust foundation for understanding the drivers of loan defaults and guide the financial institution in making data-driven decisions.
